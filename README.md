### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The most successful theater campaigns were launched in May, and the least successful were launched in December. 
2. Between May to September, there is a steady drop in the number of successful kickstarters

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. 50% or more of campaigns with a goal between $0 to $20,000 are successful 
2. 50% or more of campaigns with a goal of between $20,000  to $35,000 failed 
3. There are fewwer campaigns in total with a goal of $25,000 or more, and this causes a skew in the data. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
